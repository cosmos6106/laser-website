The Learning Analytics in STEM Education Research (LASER) Institute is a professional development program for early and mid-career scholars funded by the National Science Foundation (DRL-2025090, 2020-23; DRL-2321128; 2023-26). The LASER Institute aims to increase the capacity of early and mid-career scholars to leverage new data sources and apply computational analysis techniques (e.g., network analysis, text mining and machine learning) to support their existing research and develop new lines of inquiry.

This website contains all the materials needed to teach with, and learn from, the curriculum developed for the LASER Institute and is divided into four sections:

-   **Curriculum**.

-   **Modules**. This section includes all materials for 28 instructional modules assessing 7 distinct analytical methods. Each module includes slide decks, essential readings, discussion questions, case studies or tutorials, and assessment activities. The website also includes supporting materials for instructors such as pedagogical tips, information on computing infrastructure, technology stack, and logistics for set up.

-   **Infrastructure**.

-   **About**.
