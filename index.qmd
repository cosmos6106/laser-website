The Learning Analytics in STEM Education Research (LASER) Institute is a professional development program for early and mid-career researchers and funded by the National Science Foundation (ECR: BCSER). The LASER Institute aims to increase the capacity of early and mid-career scholars to leverage new data sources and apply computational methods (e.g., network analysis, text mining and machine learning) to support their existing research and develop new lines of inquiry. The LASER Institute is a collaborative effort between the Friday Institute for Educational Innovation at North Carolina State University, the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Florida and the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.

## What is Learning Analytics?

Learning Analytics is the measurement, collection, analysis and reporting of data about learners and their contexts, for purposes of understanding and optimising learning and the environments in which it occurs. As a research and teaching field, Learning Analytics sits at the convergence of Learning (e.g. learning and assessment sciences), Analytics (e.g. data science), and Human-Centered Design (e.g. participatory design). Learning Analytics builds on these well established disciplines, but seeks to exploit the new opportunities once we capture new forms of digital data from students' learning activity, and use computational analysis techniques from data science and AI.

## Goals of the LASER Curriculum

LASER BEAM builds upon the existing NSF-funded LASER Institute DRL-2025090 (2020-2023), which aims to deepen scholars' understanding of LA methodologies, applications, and ethical issues as they relate to STEM education; develop their proficiency with analytic tools and software to apply advanced techniques to wrangle, explore, and model STEM education data; and expand their professional networks to help further their research and provide sustained, ongoing support beyond the program. L aims to build on these efforts and scale them to a much greater scope by accomplishing the following goals:

1.  **Disciplinary Knowledge**: Scholars will deepen their understanding of LA methodologies, literature, applications and ethical issues as they relate to STEM education and equity.

2.  **Technical Skills**: Scholars will develop proficiency with R, RStudio, GitHub and other tools used for collaboration, reproducible research and computational analysis.

3.  **Social Capital**: Scholars will expand their professional networks, connecting with researchers and experts in LA related fields, as well as other scholars focused on STEM education.
