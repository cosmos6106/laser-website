The Learning Analytics in STEM Education Research (LASER) Institute is a professional development program for early and mid-career scholars funded by the National Science Foundation (DRL-2025090, 2020-23; DRL-2321128; 2023-26). The LASER Institute aims to increase the capacity of early and mid-career scholars to leverage new data sources and apply computational analysis techniques (e.g., network analysis, text mining and machine learning) to support their existing research and develop new lines of inquiry. The LASER Institute and associated curriculum materials shared on this website are designed to build the capacity of participating scholars in three core areas:

1.  **Disciplinary Knowledge**: Scholars will deepen their understanding of LA methodologies, literature, applications and ethical issues as they relate to STEM education and equity.

2.  **Technical Skills**: Scholars will develop proficiency with R/Python, Quarto, GitHub and other tools used for collaboration, reproducible research and computational analysis.

3.  **Social Capital**: Scholars will expand their professional networks, connecting with researchers and experts in LA related fields, as well as other scholars focused on STEM education.

## What is Learning Analytics?

Learning Analytics is the measurement, collection, analysis and reporting of data about learners and their contexts, for purposes of understanding and optimizing learning and the environments in which it occurs. As a research and teaching field, Learning Analytics sits at the convergence of Learning (e.g. learning and assessment sciences), Analytics (e.g. data science), and Human-Centered Design (e.g. participatory design). Learning Analytics builds on these well established disciplines, but seeks to exploit the new opportunities once we capture new forms of digital data from students' learning activity, and use computational analysis techniques from data science and AI.

## Website Organization

This website contains all the materials needed to teach with, and learn from, the LASER Institute curriculum. The content section of the website includes materials for 28 instructional modules assessing 7 distinct analytical methods. Each module includes slide decks, essential readings, discussion questions, case studies or tutorials, and assessment activities. The website also includes supporting materials for instructors such as pedagogical tips, information on computing infrastructure, technology stack, and logistics for set up.

The website is proudly built with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), an open-source scientific and technical publishing system built on Pandoc. Quarto has been used by the project team to create dynamic instructional content with Python and R, and its publishing capabilities extend to high-quality articles, reports, websites, blogs, and books using plain text and scientific markdown. The source code for the LASER website and all instructional materials will be housed on the LASER Institute GitHub site and deployed using Netlify, an all-in-one platform deploying dynamic websites from Git. Housing all materials on GitHub allows for version control and collaborative editing of curriculum materials as well as the addition of new materials that may be developed by participants.

## Participating Institutions

The LASER Institute is a collaborative effort between the Friday Institute for Educational Innovation at North Carolina State University, the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Florida and the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.
