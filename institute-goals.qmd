The LASER Institute aims to increase the capacity of early and mid-career scholars to leverage new data sources and apply advanced methods to support their research and teaching. Located at the Friday Institute for Educational Innovation, the LASER Institute is a collaborative effort between North Carolina State University, University of Pennsylvania, University of Florida and the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.

The LASER Institute and associated curriculum materials shared on this website are designed to build the capacity of participating scholars in three core areas:

1.  **Disciplinary Knowledge**: Scholars will deepen their understanding of LA methodologies, literature, applications and ethical issues as they relate to STEM education and equity.

2.  **Technical Skills**: Scholars will develop proficiency with R/Python, Quarto, GitHub and other tools used for collaboration, reproducible research and computational analysis.

3.  **Social Capital**: Scholars will expand their professional networks, connecting with researchers and experts in LA related fields, as well as other scholars focused on STEM education.

## Learning Objectives

The LASER curriculum is designed to help faculty teach current and emerging STEM education researchers to:

-   Understand which research questions/issues appropriately addressed by LA as compared to other analytical approaches and advanced methods;

-   Identify relevant sources of education data to address both theoretical and practical issues in STEM education;

-   Apply computational techniques (e.g., machine learning and text mining) using a choice of packages (R or Python) to prepare, explore, and model education data;

-   Evaluate the technical feasibility, ethical issues, and societal constraints in using analytics to support STEM teaching and learning;

-   Collaborate with educational organizations to help them learn from their own data and identify new ways to support students.
