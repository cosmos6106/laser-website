## Institute Goals

The LASER Institute and associated curriculum materials shared on this website are designed to build the capacity of participating scholars in three core areas:

1.  **Disciplinary Knowledge**: Scholars will deepen their understanding of LA methodologies, literature, applications and ethical issues as they relate to STEM education and equity.

2.  **Technical Skills**: Scholars will develop proficiency with R/Python, Quarto, GitHub and other tools used for collaboration, reproducible research and computational analysis.

3.  **Social Capital**: Scholars will expand their professional networks, connecting with researchers and experts in LA related fields, as well as other scholars focused on STEM education.

## Learning Objectives

The LASER curriculum is designed to help faculty teach current and emerging STEM education researchers to:

-   Understand which research questions/issues appropriately addressed by LA as compared to other analytical approaches and advanced methods;

-   Identify relevant sources of education data to address both theoretical and practical issues in STEM education;

-   Apply computational techniques (e.g., machine learning and text mining) using a choice of packages (R or Python) to prepare, explore, and model education data;

-   Evaluate the technical feasibility, ethical issues, and societal constraints in using analytics to support STEM teaching and learning;

-   Collaborate with educational organizations to help them learn from their own data and identify new ways to support students.
