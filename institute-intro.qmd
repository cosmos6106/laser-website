As the use of digital teaching and learning resources continues to expand, the volume and variety of data available to researchers presents new opportunities for understanding and improving STEM education.Â **The LASER Institute aims to increase the capacity of early and mid-career scholars to leverage new data sources and apply advanced methods to support their research and teaching.** Located at the Friday Institute for Educational Innovation, the LASER Institute is a collaborative effort between North Carolina State University, University of Pennsylvania, University of Florida and the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.

The LASER Institute focuses on building the capacity of scholars to conduct high-quality research in three primary domains:

-   **Disciplinary Knowledge**: Scholars will deepen their understanding of LA methodologies, literature, applications and ethical issues as they relate to STEM education and equity.

-   **Technical Skills**: Scholars will develop proficiency with R, Python, Quarto, GitHub and other tools used for collaboration, reproducible research and computational analyses.

-   **Social Capital**: Scholars will expand their professional networks, connecting with researchers and experts in LA related fields, as well as other scholars focused on STEM education.
